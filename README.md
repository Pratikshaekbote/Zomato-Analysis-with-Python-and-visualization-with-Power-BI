## Dataset
The dataset provides information like an average cost for two, location, votes, the aggregate rating, cuisines, country, rating text, etc. Various analysis like the top cuisines, most expensive restaurants, average rating for each country, and many other analysis are performed on the dataset.
The dataset's owner is Zomato and Kaggle is the source providing the data.

## Conclusion
* The dataset shows the restaurants with the highest cost for two, countries with a greater number of restaurants on Zomato, countries with 
  restaurants that offer online delivery, average aggregate rating for countries, etc.
* Based on our analysis performed, the restaurants present in different localities can improve the quality of the restaurant, deliver online, 
  work on days that have an average aggregate rating, and check for value-added restaurants to check on how they work and can implement a few techniques like including both online delivery and table booking, providing various cuisines to visitors, etc.
* It is easy for frequent visitor's filter based on the average cost for two, votes, the aggregate rating, cuisines, etc. This can be done before 
  visiting the restaurant
